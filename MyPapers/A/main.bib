Often, approaches are limited to group-level predictions, lack the ability to extrapolate, can not scale to many samples, or do not operate directly on image inputs. We address these issues with the first approach to artificial aging of brain images based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks. We develop a novel recursive generator model for brain image time series, and train it on large-scale longitudinal data sets (ADNI/AIBL). In addition to thorough analysis of results on healthy and demented subjects, we demonstrate the predictive value of our brain aging model in the context of conversion prognosis from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. Conversion prognosis for a baseline image is achieved in two steps. First, we estimate the future brain image with the Generative Adversarial Network. This follow-up image is passed to a CNN classifier, pre-trained to discriminate between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. It estimates the Alzheimer probability for the follow-up image, which represents an effective measure for future disease risk.},

abstract = {Objectives
Previous studies suggest that major depressive disorder (MDD) may be associated with volumetric indications of accelerated brain aging. This study investigated neuroanatomical signs of accelerated aging in MDD and evaluated whether a brain age gap is associated with antidepressant response.
Methods
Individuals in a major depressive episode received escitalopram treatment (10–20 mg/d) for 8 weeks. Depression severity was assessed at baseline and at weeks 8 and 16 using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Response to treatment was characterized by a significant reduction in the MADRS (≥50%). Nonresponders received adjunctive aripiprazole treatment (2–10 mg/d) for a further 8 weeks. The brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) at baseline was determined using machine learning methods trained on 3377 healthy individuals from seven publicly available datasets. The model used features from all brain regions extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging data.
Results
Brain-PAD was significantly higher in older MDD participants compared to younger MDD participants [t(147.35) = -2.35, p < 0.03]. BMI was significantly associated with brain-PAD in the MDD group [r(155) = 0.19, p < 0.03]. Response to treatment was not significantly associated with brain-PAD.
Conclusion
We found an elevated brain age gap in older individuals with MDD. Brain-PAD was not associated with overall treatment response to escitalopram monotherapy or escitalopram plus adjunctive aripiprazole.}

abstract = {Objective
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown that estimated brain age is deviant from chronological age in various common brain disorders. Brain age estimation could be useful for investigating patterns of brain maturation and integrity, aiding to elucidate brain mechanisms underlying these heterogeneous conditions. Here, we examined functional brain age in two large samples of children and adolescents and its relation to mental health.
Methods
We used resting-state fMRI data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; n = 1126, age range 8–22 years) to estimate functional connectivity between brain networks, and utilized these as features for brain age prediction. We applied the prediction model to 1387 individuals (age range 8–22 years) in the Healthy Brain Network sample (HBN). In addition, we estimated brain age in PNC using a cross-validation framework. Next, we tested for associations between brain age gap and various aspects of psychopathology and cognitive performance.
Results
Our model was able to predict age in the independent test samples, with a model performance of r = 0.54 for the HBN test set, supporting consistency in functional connectivity patterns between samples and scanners. Linear models revealed a significant association between brain age gap and psychopathology in PNC, where individuals with a lower estimated brain age, had a higher overall symptom burden. These associations were not replicated in HBN.
Discussion
Our findings support the use of brain age prediction from fMRI-based connectivity. While requiring further extensions and validations, the approach may be instrumental for detecting brain phenotypes related to intrinsic connectivity and could assist in characterizing risk in non-typically developing populations.}

We addressed the question of how age-related changes in gray matter mediate the cognitive performance during middle age. Eighty-two participants (40–50 years, ±2) were assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery covering a broad spectrum of cognitive domains and components. Mediation effects were studied with hierarchical regression and bootstrapping analysis. Results showed that more vulnerable cognitive components were related to executive functioning and in a lesser degree to processing speed. Age-related differences in gray matter mainly involved the frontal lobes. Moreover, age-related differences in visuoconstructive, visuospatial functions, reaction time, and mental flexibility and executive control were mediated by several gray matter regions. It is important to increase the knowledge of the impact of brain changes on cognitive function during middle age. To define the early stages of the aging process may allow early detection of pathologic changes and therapeutic interventions.},

ABSTRACT={The hive database system (theHiveDB) is a web-based brain imaging database, collaboration, and activity system which has been designed as an imaging workflow management system capable of handling cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-center studies. It can be used to organize and integrate existing data from heterogeneous projects as well as data from ongoing studies. It has been conceived to guide and assist the researcher throughout the entire research process, integrating all relevant types of data across modalities (e.g., brain imaging, clinical, and genetic data). TheHiveDB is a modern activity and resource management system capable of scheduling image processing on both private compute resources and the cloud. The activity component supports common image archival and management tasks as well as established pipeline processing (e.g., Freesurfer for extraction of scalar measures from magnetic resonance images). Furthermore, via theHiveDB activity system algorithm developers may grant access to virtual machines hosting versioned releases of their tools to collaborators and the imaging community. The application of theHiveDB is illustrated with a brief use case based on organizing, processing, and analyzing data from the publically available Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.}

	abstract = {Cognitive aging is highly complex. We applied a data-driven statistical method to investigate aging from a hierarchical, multidimensional, and multivariate approach. Orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures and hierarchical models were applied for the first time in a study of cognitive aging. The association between age and a total of 316 demographic, clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging measures was simultaneously analyzed in 460 cognitively normal individuals (35–85 years). Age showed a strong association with brain structure, especially with cortical thickness in frontal and parietal association regions. Age also showed a fairly strong association with cognition. Although a strong association of age with executive functions and processing speed was captured as expected, the association of age with visual memory was stronger. Clinical measures were less strongly associated with age. Hierarchical and correlation analyses further showed these associations in a neuroimaging-cognitive-clinical order of importance. We conclude that orthogonal partial least square and hierarchical models are a promising approach to better understand the complexity in cognitive aging.},

	abstract = {The integrity of the cholinergic system plays a central role in cognitive decline both in normal aging and neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease and vascular cognitive impairment. Most of the previous neuroimaging research has focused on the integrity of the cholinergic basal forebrain, or its sub-region the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). Tractography using diffusion tensor imaging data may enable modelling of the NBM white matter projections. We investigated the contribution of NBM volume, NBM white matter projections, small vessel disease (SVD), and age to performance in attention and memory in 262 cognitively normal individuals (39–77 years of age, 53\% female). We developed a multimodal MRI pipeline for NBM segmentation and diffusion-based tracking of NBM white matter projections, and computed white matter hypointensities (WM-hypo) as a marker of SVD. We successfully tracked pathways that closely resemble the spatial layout of the cholinergic system as seen in previous post-mortem and DTI tractography studies. We found that high WM-hypo load was associated with older age, male sex, and lower performance in attention and memory. A high WM-hypo load was also associated with lower integrity of the cholinergic system above and beyond the effect of age. In a multivariate model, age and integrity of NBM white matter projections were stronger contributors than WM-hypo load and NBM volume to performance in attention and memory. We conclude that the integrity of NBM white matter projections plays a fundamental role in cognitive aging. This and other modern neuroimaging methods offer new opportunities to re-evaluate the cholinergic hypothesis of cognitive aging.},

	abstract = {This paper describes DARTEL, which is an algorithm for diffeomorphic image registration. It is implemented for both 2D and 3D image registration and has been formulated to include an option for estimating inverse consistent deformations. Nonlinear registration is considered as a local optimisation problem, which is solved using a Levenberg–Marquardt strategy. The necessary matrix solutions are obtained in reasonable time using a multigrid method. A constant Eulerian velocity framework is used, which allows a rapid scaling and squaring method to be used in the computations. DARTEL has been applied to intersubject registration of 471 whole brain images, and the resulting deformations were evaluated in terms of how well they encode the shape information necessary to separate male and female subjects and to predict the ages of the subjects.},

Significant age effects were found for all volumes except pallidum and the 4th ventricle. Heterogeneous age responses were seen in that age relationships for cortex, amygdala, thalamus, the accumbens area, and caudate were linear, while cerebral white matter, hippocampus, brainstem, cerebellar white, and gray matter, as well as volume of the lateral, inferior lateral, and 3rd ventricles showed curvilinear relationships with age.

abstract = {Brain disorders are characterized by the progressive loss of structure and function of the brain as a consequence of progressive degeneration and/or death of nerve cells. Aging is a major risk factor for brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and stroke. Various cellular and molecular events have been shown to play a role in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging studies suggest that primary cilia could be a key regulator in brain diseases. The primary cilium is a singular cellular organelle expressed on the surface of many cell types, such as astrocytes and neurons in the mature brain. Primary cilia detect extracellular cues, such as Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein, and transduce these signals into cells to regulate various signaling pathways. Abnormalities in ciliary length and frequency (ratio of ciliated cells) have been implicated in various human diseases, including brain disorders. This review summarizes current findings and thoughts on the role of primary cilia and ciliary signaling pathways in aging and age-related brain disorders.}

	urls = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10282},
	abstract = {We introduce a learning strategy for contrast-invariant image registration without requiring imaging data. While classical registration methods accurately estimate the spatial correspondence between images, they solve a costly optimization problem for every image pair. Learning-based techniques are fast at test time, but can only register images with image contrast and geometric content that are similar to those available during training. We focus on removing this image-data dependency of learning methods. Our approach leverages a generative model for diverse label maps and images that exposes networks to a wide range of variability during training, forcing them to learn features invariant to image type (contrast). This strategy results in powerful networks trained to generalize to a broad array of real input images. We present extensive experiments, with a focus on 3D neuroimaging, showing that this strategy enables robust registration of arbitrary image contrasts without the need to retrain for new modalities. We demonstrate registration accuracy that most often surpasses the state of the art both within and across modalities, using a single model. Critically, we show that input labels from which we synthesize images need not be of actual anatomy: training on randomly generated geometric shapes also results in competitive registration performance, albeit slightly less accurate, while alleviating the dependency on real data of any kind.

ABSTRACT={We propose a new framework for estimating neuroimaging-derived “brain-age” at a local level within the brain, using deep learning. The local approach, contrary to existing global methods, provides spatial information on anatomical patterns of brain ageing. We trained a U-Net model using brain MRI scans from n = 3,463 healthy people (aged 18–90 years) to produce individualised 3D maps of brain-predicted age. When testing on n = 692 healthy people, we found a median (across participant) mean absolute error (within participant) of 9.5 years. Performance was more accurate (MAE around 7 years) in the prefrontal cortex and periventricular areas. We also introduce a new voxelwise method to reduce the age-bias when predicting local brain-age “gaps.” To validate local brain-age predictions, we tested the model in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia using data from OASIS3 (n = 267). Different local brain-age patterns were evident between healthy controls and people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, particularly in subcortical regions such as the accumbens, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, and amygdala. Comparing groups based on mean local brain-age over regions-of-interest resulted in large effects sizes, with Cohen's d values >1.5, for example when comparing people with stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment. Our local brain-age framework has the potential to provide spatial information leading to a more mechanistic understanding of individual differences in patterns of brain ageing in health and disease.}
