## Templates

### KTH Thesis Overleaf Templates

Based on my research, there is no official thesis template provided by our school. However, I found two templates that I like:
- [Thesis Template on GitHub](https://github.com/marcusklasson/thesis)
- [KTH PhD Kappa Template on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/kth-phd-kappa-template/hycgtrvmxtmn)

### KTH Slides Template

KTH provides official PowerPoint templates:

## Writing

The final dissertation is based on the publications included in your PhD. As a first step, collect all the publications you wish to include in the thesis.

### Reference Management

I use Zotero to manage my references. It can be uploaded directly to Overleaf, and you can create a group library for your thesis.
